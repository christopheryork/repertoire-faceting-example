known bugs:

- the alphabetic/numeric ordering example is not working as of rep.ajax.toolkit 0.2.0
  state/pre_update is too low-level for the model-centric design... require subclassing in this case?

- nested facets - when a child is named same as parent, it deselects it rather than refining

heroku migration:

- check still runs on rails 3.2.11 [ cfrp ], 
                            3.2.14 [ us-iran ], 
                            3.2.16 [ annotation studio ], 
                            4.0.2 [ repertoire-faceting-example ] 
- check repertoire-assets on heroku
- create heroku instance for app
