      # Abstract interface all facet implementations must fulfil.  At minimum, implementors should
      # define self.claim?(), signature(), and drill() to create a new kind of facet.

      # For indexing support, implement create_index(), refresh_index(), and drop_index(). Detect the
      # index's presence in signature() and drill(), and act accordingly.
      #
      # N.B. Facet instances can assume they have been mixed in with an ActiveRecord::Relation and
      #      Repertoire::Faceting::Model (see the mixin() method below). Think of them as scoped
      #      relations that identify an attribute of the model dataset.
