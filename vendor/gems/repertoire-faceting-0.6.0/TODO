DESIRED FEATURES / IMPROVEMENTS.

-- mysql support
   [ design: mysql has a count function and bitwise operators for blobs.
     Adding support is a matter of defining the adapter and moving signature()
     calls into the postgresql adapter ]

-- modify widgets to multiplex ajax calls to work around 2 call limit 
   in many browsers
   [ design: fetch() queues ajax calls; update() implementations request 
     queue  and merge current webservice call with ones already in the queue.
     on controller side, receive multiple facet names, iterate, and bundle.
     fetch() then unbundles the results can dispatches them to appropriate
     callbacks ]


TODO

-- clean up population in postgresql adapter?
-- clean up throughout the facet definitions
-- test harness
   - test all extensions in order, skipping if cannot load
-- simplify the in-database API
   - use materialized views instead of dropping and adding tables
   - move signature_wastage into an aggregate function
   - remove the renumber function
   - the only remaining function should be expand_nesting
-- reference to the ActiveRecord API in the README
-- revise the README to describe API layers & use
-- Makefile is verbose; use patterns
