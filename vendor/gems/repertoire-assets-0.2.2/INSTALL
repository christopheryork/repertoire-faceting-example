Repertoire Assets
=================


(1) Make sure your application loads the middleware.  For Rails 3.0,
    including repertoire-assets in your Gemfile does this automatically.
    
	For Merb and others, you will need to alter your rackup file.  The
	middleware takes two optional arguments: a configuration hash and
	the system logger.

      <app>/config/rack.rb (Mongrel)
      <app>/config.ru      (Passenger) 
  
*        require 'repertoire-assets'
*        use Repertoire::Assets::Processor, Merb::Config, Merb.logger
    
         run Merb::Rack::Application.new


(2) Turn on precaching and compression in your production environment,
    so gem assets are served by your web server. e.g. for Rails:
  
    <app>/config/environments/production.rb:
  
*        config.repertoire_assets.compress = true

    Or in Merb:
  
    <app>/config/environments/production.rb:

*        c[:compress] = true

    For other options that can be used in the configuration hash, see the
    documentation for Repertoire::Assets::Processor.
