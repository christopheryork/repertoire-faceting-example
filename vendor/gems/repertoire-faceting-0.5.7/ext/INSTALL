This directory contains two bindings for the PostgreSQL in-database faceting API:

- 'signature', a C datatype extension to PostgreSQL. The standard API.

  To load, either follow the directions in the gem-wide INSTALL (the recommended path)
      or, to install by hand:
    $   cd ext/signature
    $   sudo make install
    $   psql -Upostgres <your-database>
    #=  CREATE EXTENSION faceting;

- 'bit', based on Postgres BIT data type. The API for use on shared hosts.

  To load, either follow the directions in the gem-wide INSTALL
      or, to install by hand:

    $   psql -Upostgres <your-database>
    $   \i ext/bit/bit.sql

See the gem README for more information on using the API.
