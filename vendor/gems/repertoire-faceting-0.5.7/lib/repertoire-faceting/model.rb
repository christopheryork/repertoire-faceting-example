      #
      # == Facet declarations
      #
      # Facet declarations consist of a facet name and an optional ActiveRecord relation that describes
      # the attribute column to facet over, any joins necessary to reach it, and other defaults. They
      # work similarly to Rails scoped queries.  For example:
      #
      #   class Nobelist < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     include Repertoire::Faceting::Model
      #     has_many :affiliations
      #
      #     facet :discipline
      #     facet :degree,     joins(:affiliations).group('affiliations.degree')
      #     facet :birthdate,  order('birthdate ASC')
      #   end
      #
      # Implicitly, any facet declaration is an SQL aggregate that divides the attribute values into discrete
      # groups.  When no relation is provided, /model/.group(/facet name/) is assumed by default.  So the 
      # discipline facet declaration above is equivalent to
      #
      #   facet :discipline, group(:discipline)
      #
      # and the grouping on degree could be left out.  You can use this behavior to construct a facet 
      # from differently-named columns:
      #
      #   facet :balloon_color, group(:color)
      #
      # or to synthesize values using an SQL expression:
      #
      #   facet :birth_year, group('EXTRACT(year FROM birthdate)')
      #
      # As shown above, facets can be constructed from an arbitrary set of joined tables.
      #
      # == Nested facets
      #
      # Facets can be built from a nested hierarchy of values by providing multiple group columns.  In this
      # case, value counts are aggregated at each level in turn.
      #
      #   facet :birth_place, group(:birth_country, :birth_state, :birth_city)
      #
      # As for basic facets, nested facets may consist of SQL expressions.  This is particularly useful in
      # faceting over data in more complex types such as dates or geographical regions:
      #
      #   facet :birth_date, group('EXTRACT(year FROM birthdate)', 'EXTRACT(month FROM birthdate)', 'EXTRACT(day FROM birthdate)')
      #
      # == Facet options
      #
      # The following query options can also be specified in the facet declaration.
      #
      # [order] Order for facet value counts.  Two computed columns are available, "count" and another with the
      #         facet's name.  For example, to order a genre facet alphanumerically within each descending count:
      #           facet :genre, order('count DESC', 'genre ASC')
      #
      # [nils] Whether to include null facet values in the results or not.  Defaults to true:
      #          facet :genre, nils(false)
      #
      # [minimum] Cut-off below which facet value counts should not be listed:
      #             facet :genre, minimum(5)
      #
      # == Executing Queries
      #
      # Facet value count and result queries follow the format familiar from ActiveRecord group and count
      # aggregation.  This allows you to execute a facet value count query given a base set of records.
      #
      #   Nobelist.where("name LIKE 'Robert%").count(:discipline)
      #
      # To incorporate refinements on other facets on this model, use refine:
      #
      #   Nobelist.refine(:nobel_year => 2001, :degree => 'Ph.D.').count(:discipline)
      # 
      # If you provide multiple values for a simple facet refinement, they are interpreted as a logical "or":
      #
      #   Nobelist.refine(:nobel_year => [2000, 2001])     # => 'WHERE name IN (2000, 2001)'
      #
      # In the case of a nested facet, multiple values identify levels in the taxonomy:
      # 
      #   Nobelist.refine(:birth_place => [ 'Ukraine', 'Kiev' ]).count(:nobel_year)
      #
      # Refinements are integrated into result queries automatically:
      #
      #   Nobelist.refine(:birth_place => [ 'Ukraine', 'Kiev' ]).all
      #
      # == Index access
      #
      # As you will have noted already, facet counts and queries are quite similar to their ActiveRecord/SQL
      # counterparts.  Behind the scenes, the Repertoire faceting code re-writes your query.  
      #
      # Facets defined on associations are joined and limited automatically, and facet indices in the database 
      # are used wherever possible rather than querying the model table.
      #
      # == Facet registration
      #
      # The system supports plugins for new facet type implementations.  When a new facet is declared, the
      # available facet implementations are polled until one claims the new relation.  For example, of the
      # built-in facet implementations, BasicFacet claims facets with a single group column, and NestedFacet
      # claims those with several group columns.  If several facet implementations claim a facet, the one
      # that registered later wins.
      #
      # See AbstractFacet for more details.
      #
      module ClassMethods
        
        # Declare a facet by name
        def facet(name, rel=nil)
          name = name.to_sym

          # default: group by column with facet name, order by count descending
          rel ||= scoped_all
          rel = rel.group(name)                           if rel.group_values.empty?
          rel = rel.order(["count DESC", "#{name} ASC"])  if rel.order_values.empty?

          # locate facet implementation that can handle relation
          facets[name] = Facets::AbstractFacet.mixin(name, rel)
        end

        def facet?(name)

        # indices for the facets with the provided names.  If no names are provided, 
        # then the existing facet indices are refreshed.
        #
        # If a signature id column name is provided, it will be used to build the
