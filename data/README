This directory contains data to extend that in the repertoire-faceting/spec directory.  To load, you must have
the PostGIS geographical information system installed:

sudo port install postgis

<restart PostgreSQL>

psql -Upostgres -d repertoire_testing -f /opt/local/share/postgresql84/contrib/postgis.sql 
psql -Upostgres -d repertoire_testing -f /opt/local/share/postgresql84/contrib/spatial_ref_sys.sql

Then install the sample dataset (this will take about 30 mins):

cd data
rake						# this downloads the GIS & economics datasets and loads them into the database

You can then run the example GIS earth faceting demo.
