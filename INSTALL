=== Running the Repertoire Faceting Demo

Rails recommendation is to use database-specific schema dump and seeding files
unless your application is explicitly cross-database. However, for clarity
migrations are used in the demo application.

Build the faceting library and install it in your PostgreSQL database server.

$ rake db:faceting:extensions:install     { sudo will prompt your password }

Set up the demo's database and load the faceting extensions.

$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate

Load with sample data (this can take a while... get a coffee).

$ rake db:seeds:generate               { creates data/citizens.sql }
$ cat data/*.sql | psql -Upostgres repertoire_faceting_example

And add the facet indices and run:

$ rake reindex
$ bundle exec rails s                  { see http://localhost:3000/nobelists }
